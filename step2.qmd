# Step 2 - Automated processing procedure {.unnumbered}

Determining positions using light‐level geolocation can be achieved using threshold methods and curve‐fitting methods [@RN14382]. Using the light-level and time information contained in the **raw logger data (a)**, we applied an automated processing procedure to determine, filter, and edit twilight events and calculate geographic positions using the threshold method (@fig-expl). The procedure is described in detail in @RN14582. It further removes unrealistic positions using filters on equinox periods, speed, distribution, angle, distance, variation in timing of twilights and mid-night sun periods and smooths positions. The one aspect not automated is the calibration of sun elevation angles, crucial to estimate the latitudinal aspect of positions. It is based on a subjective, but high repeatability assessment for each annual track for each bird.

The automated processing procedure yields a **filtered location dataset (b)** for each of the eleven SEATRACK species containing up to two locations per bird and day (one location at noon and one at midnight), with a total of 3 945 645 unique processed locations from 3 933 individuals for the eleven species tracked (@tbl-overview).
