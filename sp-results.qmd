# The knowledge gained - species by species {.unnumbered}

This section details the knowledge gained for each of the eleven species included in SEATRACK thus far. The results presented utilize the **abundance dataset (f)** to make inferences about the *abundance* of the six pelagic species within the SEATRACK dataset (black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar, little auk, Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, and Br√ºnnich's guillemot). Additionally, species *diversity* has been estimated using the **diversity dataset (e)** based on the entire SEATRACK dataset of all elven species. Timing of breeding and migration in turn are based on the **breeding timing dataset (c)** (available for the 6 pelagic species and common eiders) and **migration timing dataset (h)** (available for the 6 pelagic species), respectively. Finally, migration corridors are assessed using the **migration routes intensity datasets (d)** (available for the 6 pelagic species).
