# Important areas for seabirds breeding in NOMA {.unnumbered}

Seabirds breeding in the three NOMA display clear differential space use strategies during the annual cycle both in term of species diversity (Figure 19) as well as abundance (Figure 18). The Barents Sea NOMA seabird community is the only one that spent the majority of its time within its NOMA year-round. Contrastingly, birds breeding in the Norwegian and North Sea NOMAs spent most of their time within the general North Atlantic outside of NOMA (Table 4).
