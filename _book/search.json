The total breeding population in the Northeast Atlantic is estimated at 5 000 - 6 000 breeding pairs (Table 41), with the majority breeding in the eastern and northern Barents Sea and on Iceland (Petersen et al., 2015).\n\n\nTable 1: Glaucous gull population sizes within each Norwegian Ocean Management Area (NOMA) and the Northeast Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry/region\nNumber of breeding pairs\nPercent covered by the abundance dataset (f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the Barents Sea\n\n\n\n\nSvalbard (w/o Bjørnøya)\n                1 300\n98%\n\n\nBjørnøya\n                   650\n100%\n\n\nSubtotal\n                1 950\n99%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the Norwegian Sea\n\n\n\n\nJan Mayen\n                   200\n0%\n\n\nSubtotal\n                   200\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the North Sea\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal\n            0\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Atlantic outside NOMA\n\n\n\n\nRussian European Arctic\n                1 250\n26%\n\n\nIceland\n                1 750\n100%\n\n\nSubtotal\n                3 000\n69%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n                5 150\n78%\n\n\n\n\nThe glaucous gull is a generalist predator that feeds on a wide variety of fish, molluscs, crustaceans, eggs, chicks and adults of other seabirds, insects, carrion, refuse and offal. Birds breeding in or close to bird colonies are often specialized in preying upon eggs, chicks, and adult birds of certain seabird species (Bustnes et al., 2003).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Glaucous gull general geographic range (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. v2021-3).

Population declines may be attributable to egg harvest, contaminants, or food shortages, but other factors operating outside the breeding season should not be excluded (Petersen et al., 2015). Overall population trends seem to be stable. The species is red listed in Norway (Table 42)."

    "text": "Which areas are used by birds breeding in each NOMA throughout the year?\nGlaucous gulls breeding in the Barents Sea NOMA mainly stay in the western Barents Sea throughout the year (Figure 105). Those individuals experience polar night during winter, precluding location estimation (Figure 106). Consequently, the temporal data coverage for these populations is low during mid-winter. A part of the populations breeding in West Svalbard (Kongsfjorden) migrate as far south as Iceland and the Faroe Islands (Figure 105). Most of the Barents Sea NOMA populations spend their autumn around Svalbard and move south towards the coasts of northern Norway (from Lofoten to eastern Finnmark) during winter.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Diversity. Seasonal space use of tracked Glaucous gull populations breeding in the three NOMA areas as well as the rest of the North Atlantic. Space use is visualised as 75% kernel utilization distribution contours. Note that locations could not be estimated during the equinox periods as well as during polar night conditions at high latitudes (Figure 8). Colony locations are coloured by region (Figure 3). Grey shapes indicate seasonal average 90% sea ice cover during the study period."

The results presented utilize the abundance dataset (f) to make inferences about the abundance of the six most abundant seabird species within the SEATRACK dataset as well as the North Atlantic (black-legged kittiwake, Northern fulmar, little auk, Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, and Brünnich’s guillemot). Additionally, species diversity has been estimated using the diversity dataset (e) based on the entire SEATRACK dataset of all elven species. Timing of breeding and migration in turn are based on the breeding timing dataset (c) (available for the 6 pelagic species and common eiders) and migration timing dataset (h) (available for the 6 pelagic species), respectively. Finally, migration corridors are assessed using the migration routes intensity datasets (d) (available for the 6 pelagic species)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This section details seabird area use and its seasonal dynamics within each of the three Norwegian Ocean Management Areas (NOMA). The abundance models are able to resolve the year-round spatial density distribution of 97% of the seabird populations breeding across the Northeast Atlantic composed of the six pelagic seabird species within SEATRACK (Table 3). With these estimates we can make inferences about total abundances of seabirds present in each NOMA. It is apparent that numerically most seabirds are found within the Barents Sea NOMA year-round, followed by the Norwegian Sea. Least amount of birds are present in the North Sea. The most abundant species in each NOMA is the Atlantic puffin, while in the Barents Sea the Brünnich’s guillemot is as abundant (Figure 9). Further, seabirds in each NOMA display distinct space use patterns. Most birds in the Barents Sea NOMA concentrate in the central southern part of this NOMA both in absolute (Figure 11) and relative terms (Figure 12) as well as in displayed species diversity (Figure 16). In contrast, both in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea NOMAs, most birds are found on the periphery of each respective area. The main concentration of birds in the Norwegian Sea NOMA can be found on the border to the Barents Sea and towards the Faroe Islands, while birds in the North Sea NOMA are mainly concentrated on the border closest to Scotland (Figure 11 and Figure 12)."

    "text": "Determining positions using light‐level geolocation can be achieved using threshold methods and curve‐fitting methods (Lisovski et al. 2020). Using the light-level and time information contained in the raw logger data (a), we applied an automated processing procedure to determine, filter, and edit twilight events and calculate geographic positions using the threshold method (Figure 1). The procedure is described in detail in Bråthen et al. (2021). It further removes unrealistic positions using filters on equinox periods, speed, distribution, angle, distance, variation in timing of twilights and mid-night sun periods and smooths positions. The one aspect not automated is the calibration of sun elevation angles, crucial to estimate the latitudinal aspect of positions. It is based on a subjective, but high repeatability assessment for each annual track for each bird.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Conceptual illustration of information used to estimate locations from light level data using the threshold method.\n\n\nThe automated processing procedure yields a filtered location dataset (b) for each of the eleven SEATRACK species containing up to two locations per bird and day (one location at noon and one at midnight), with a total of 3 945 645 unique processed locations from 3 933 individuals for the eleven species tracked (Table 1).\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of tracking data collected as part of SEATRACK inside and outside the Norwegian Ocean Management areas (Figure 3).
